            <p>
                Koalateer is a nonprofit organization where we match students with volunteer opportunities that cater to
                their interests. This is to limit uncertainty through third-party websites and to get reliable
                information on an opportunity with interest to the individual. Our application plans to have a
                rewarding aspect to it, to make volunteering competitive, yet fun, and a social media aspect for all
                volunteers to connect and share their experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                This company was inspired by students who themselves
                had struggled to find volunteer positions, especially during quarantine, to fulfill requirements and for
                the college admissions process. This took the fun out of volunteering. With Koalateer we are shifting
                the mindset of volunteering from an obligation to a joyful, exciting activity.

            </h1>

            <p>
                High school and college students today are less likely to volunteer or give to charity than those of 15
                years ago. A lack of awareness of opportunities and the inabilty to find volunteer opportunities that
                lead them to stop volunteering all together.
