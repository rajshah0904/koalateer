            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <br>
            <p id="desc">Koalateer is a nonprofit organization where we match students with volunteer opportunities that
                cater to their interests. This is to limit uncertainty through third-party websites and to get reliable
                information on an opportunity with interest to the individual. This application plans to have a
                rewarding aspect to it, to make volunteering competitive, yet fun, and a social media aspect for all
                volunteers to connect and share their experiences.
                This company was inspired by students who themselves had struggled to find volunteer positions,
                especially during quarantine, to fulfill requirements and for the college admissions process. This took
                the fun out of volunteering. With Koalateer we are shifting the mindset of volunteering from an
                obligation to a joyful, exciting activity.
